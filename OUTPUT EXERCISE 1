I woke up at 6:30 everyday and perform my prayer.
Then I ate my breakfast with my family at 7.00 a.m.
On Sunday my class started at 10:30 a.m. , so after breakfast I spent my morning by helping my mother.
Usually I did some chores and watered the plant.
At 9.00 a.m, I took a bath and then get ready to attend my online class.
After setted up my laptop and make sure my internet connection is okay, I waited for my lecturer to start the class.
I did my programming along with my lecturer in class from 10:30 untill 12:30.
Next,I attended other classes.
After my class end,I did some exercise with creathing new coding .
Then I make sure that I did not perfome any mistake with my coding by refering to my friend.
At night, after dinner I go to bed.
